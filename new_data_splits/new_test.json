The first time I went I had the Roasted Half Chicken, and it was delicious - tender, juicy, and excellently flavored with herbs, predominately rosemary. My daughter had it a few months ago when we went again, and it was just as good.\nOne time I had the grilled duck breast, and it was also delicious, and the accompanying veggies were perfectly cooked (not overdone) and were a creative mix. I also tried a great house salad then, and the vinaigrette was well done and not too heavily applied.\nBut the last time I went was on a Friday, and the place was hopping busy (good for them - I always like to see a Madison restaurant getting business). Two of us had the steak frites, and honestly, the ribeyes were ok, but my guy actually makes far better steaks at home (he has a gift). But I wouldn't have held that against them so much, except the frites part of the meal was a big disappointment.\nThree of us had frites with our meal, and even though the place was busy so the kitchen should have been cranking out fries constantly, all of us had lukewarm soggy fries. These are matchstick fries, people, which should be crispy on the outside and just a hint of tender on the inside. Clearly, the kitchen hadn't bothered to cook our frites just for us, and you know, for an entree that cost $23, we should have received freshly cooked fries.\nHaving said that, I am probably going to try Sadine, and the frites, again. Maybe some terrible tragedy was taking shape in the kitchen that night. I always give a place at least two tries before I pan it for good.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Can't understand the hype.

I started looking for a newborn photographer when I was six months pregnant.  I live all the way up in the northwest part of the city but traveling to Henderson to Stephanie's studio was the most reasonable option financially.  I talked to Stephanie on the phone and she was so nice!  She said she wanted to know as soon as I was going to the hospital to have my baby so that she could make sure we got a slot scheduled at the perfect age (7-10 days is what she recommended).  She said she didn't care what time of day it was but to call her anyway.  I thought wow, this is a woman who truly cares about her business (she doesn't, you will see why in a few).  When we arrived with our brand new baby for pictures, they both looked like disheveled messes.  Husband in sweatpants with his stomach hanging out and Stephanie looking like she just woke up from a nap.  I realize this isn't nice to say but it is what it is.  Our newborn pictures came out amazing so I thought, who cares if they're a little strange.  We talked about doing 6 month pictures and then doing a cake smash for my sons first birthday.  She said if I do all three milestones, then she makes a beautiful video with the images set to music.  For the price and the quality it was a no brainer.  Not only did I go back for 6 month and first year photos, I also snuck in an extra session giving her even more of my money.  As my son got older, the quality of the pictures got progressively worse.  Stephanie had always been such a good communicator and we talked about what I wanted for my first year photos.  I sent her pictures that i had seen on pinterest just to give her an idea of what I liked.  She said that we could go across the street to the park and do some outdoor ones as well.  We showed up to do the outdoor pictures first and there was no park.  There was a tree on a curb where she took the worlds worst pictures.  In order to exclude the street and houses around she made the entire background white taking out all elements of the outdoors.  I was so upset.  The indoor pictures came out much better.  Because the outdoor ones were so terrible she offered to redo them AND in our area so that we wouldn't have to drive! I thought once again, she really does care about her work and her reputation.  We went to a park (an actual park) as planned but there was a wedding so we couldn't get in.  You would think she would have checked on this first, nope.  She then took us to a little tiny grassy area in the middle of a busy neighborhood.  I was so mad I thought let's just get this over with, I'm done.  These pictures came out pretty bad too due to her over editing them.  Now she has pretty much cut off all contact and even had a new \"office manager\" respond to me telling me that I will NOT be receiving my end of year video because she did a family session outdoors for free.  The outdoor session was to replace the horrible first year photos, not my video.  I complained and complained and she finally responded saying she will fix this.  I have checked in with no response and have not received my video.  My son is now almost 18 months old.  Spend the extra money people!! This is NOT worth the aggravation!!

She agreed that my hair needed some work to be fixed and we agreed on a dark blonde (which looked like a medium/light brown) mixed in with blonde highlights in order to give my hair that bayalage look. She mentioned it would be expensive and how much it would be since I agreed to do what it took to get my hair the way I wanted it to be.

I was told after my hair was done that what I wanted could take sometimes 2-4 appointments. I cannot afford to spend another 350 on hair. Just wish I would have known this before I agreed so I could have just gone somewhere else. I did explain to the dresser that I was not happy with the outcome and that it was so dark and I could not see the blonde but she just explained that we were correcting what was done before so we went darker.

On the other hand, everything else..\n\nThe location is the major seller of this hotel, being in the middle of the most popular neighborhoods for tourists. But if you are driving, be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for their valet parking. The fee when we visited in Oct 2017 was $35CAD per night with in/out privileges. However, due to the space issue in the area their lot is not directly on site, so you have to call the front desk 15 minutes in advance to when you actually need you car. We ended up parking at a nearby lot for $18CAD/night.\n\nWe checked in on a Friday and the front desk attendant was friendly enough, she informed us that our room was in a different building and a valet would come to help us with our bags. We weren't sure what this meant so we just went with it. We were sent 2 blocks away into a tiny building with a restaurant and bar directly underneath us. This should have been a red flag, but we were too tired and confused.\n\nWe didn't realize that most of the rooms would not be in the main building. And that there would be no elevator. Our room was small and dated, but had a rustic feel to it with the exposed walls, wooden floors, and oversized windows. The view was obstructed by the building across the street, but we didn't really care too much. The room was clean enough, and came stocked with a full kitchen which was nice.\n\nIt all seemed fine until nighttime came. The beds here are extremely soft, something I am not used to, but I'm sure many others would love. The restaurant and bar downstairs was listed to close at 11, and the from desk even confirmed it. But for some reason, the music(and extremely heavy bass) was still going very loudly until past 1am. Even with our windows and curtains tightly shut, we could hear the restaurant's customer on the street being loud. We couldn't say for sure if they were drunk, but either way they were painfully loud. The bf is not by any means a light sleeper, and even he lost sleep. We ended up not being able to get up as early as we had planned because we were both just too tired. The next night was Saturday and by 9pm the noise got significantly louder. We wanted to go to bed but even if we had purchased earplugs, the thumping of the bass was enough to disturb us. We called the front desk, and they offered to move us. After about 40 minutes, we were moved to another building about 3 blocks away. They tried to explain that noise is a common issue in the neighborhood, but I don't think it is since our new room was nice and quiet for the rest of our stay (and on a Saturday night). Additinally, I don't know if our complaining had anything to do with the fact that when we called in for a razor, they came back 20m later to say that they were out of razors and didn't offer me any alternative solutions (like, where can I go buy one, will they have more the day after, etc.??).\n\nWhile I greatly appreciate their moving us to a different room without much hassle, I also really don't understand how they can operate their business this way. The entire first building we stayed must be a nightmare to stay in at night. Also, when I asked, the front desk assured me that the resraurant/bar closed at 11pm- but they had their music and custormers outside well past 1am! If you're going to try to cover that up, at least try harder. She sounded confused as to why I would complain, and I had to justify it by saying that we slept early since we like getting an early start.\n\nOverall, I really don't think we would stay here again or recommend it to our friends.

She then filed the edge of my nail and the top nail bed with a rather harsh file. Not exactly relaxing, or good for the nails. She directed me to the handwashing station, where you wash your hands with dollar store dial soap and dry with shabby, dingy washcloths. Then started the gels. The UV light had only one setting, and I had to keep putting my hand in and out to restart the timer. Once the color was on and set, she wiped them with alcohol and did a quick hand massage with some kind of green lotion in a bottle labeled \"alcohol\". The entire manicure lasted less than 20 minutes and was $35 credit, $32 cash.\n\nUpon more detailed inspection, I can tell this manicure isn't going to last.

I don't want to fuss over their card points wtv thing. If I want to go with my family out of the blue somewhere, this experience just isn't worth 200$.\n\nMovies themselves aren't that impressive anymore, so it would make sense to make a theater more about the actual experience of a theater. \n\nMore comfortable plush chairs for the general seating, like guzzo, please!\nAlso tried the extra priced reserved seating once, said we could lean our seats back. Was the worst experience ever because the seats were hard plastic chairs lmfao this isn't an XXX film. Butt went numb halfway through the movie! Never again! What a horrible business choice, are they fkn retarded?!\n\nI wouldn't mind paying DOUBLE or maybe even tripple the price for actual couch seats, which the price can compensate the theater since it would mean less seats inside, but that can be a great thing because it would mean it would be less crowded! Now that is a luxurious experience! Maybe even add tables! I know that's a crazy idea, but hey, we don't have huge screens like this at home, and there is no sound system as awesome as ones in a theater, no matter how much we pay. It will never feel as epic as a theater. Nice idea for a treat above regular movie experiences once in a while.\n\nWhy not reserve 1-2 theater rooms for special seats that move like they have in theater parks? Can rotate the films, and just handle the way the seats move and vibrate. (of course include 3d glasses, but have the film in actual... REAL 3D! not the fake disapointing cheap rip off ones) We would GLADLY pay extra for this experience in Montreal!

I'm sure people would be ok to pay more for such tickets, but not as much as a regular movie ticket because it's not as long, and they'd want to come back each week, since they're hooked. Honestly I feel that would help us stop binge watching so much. This can be a fun idea for people who want to rewatch the entire show as they wait a few months for a new season to begin, but I don't know how they'd organize this into the schedule. But honestly, there are some shows that would look great on a large screen because of the artistry/themes, like Vikings, etc. Fk it just take the most popular shows, and do like they did in the old days, and let us use your screens lol I wouldn't mind spending 30 min in the theater watching Rick & Morty.

Disappointing (sigh).  \n\nAs for my pasta, I found the wide egg noodles to be unappealing, reminiscent of tuna noodle casserole.  The tomatoes were baby cherry tomatoes, which were tasty but scant.

Both had doors to the bathroom but the door in between the bedroom and living room was broken and kept locking automatically. This meant that if someone had locked the bathroom door whoever was in the bedroom was stuck in there. Talk about a fire hazard! There were also mystery stains on the wallpaper and carpeting. The pullout sofa bed was horribly uncomfortable according to my sister and the two beds in the bedroom area were full size, not queens. Also, the kitchen was not really a kitchen since they didn't provide any silverware or anything. It just had a tiny sink, hotel size fridge, Kuerig coffee maker and small microwave. For $200 a night I would expect a lot more.\n\nI would not stay here again. If (knock wood) I had to come back to the hospital I would stay at the other Intercontinental hotel. We ate there a couple times and it looked much nicer. I will say that I have given this hotel an extra star because of the staff.

There was a large piece of Chinese broccoli and I wish they could cut it a bit so it's easier to eat the stick that's more than half the size of my face; hence the one star deduction.\n\nService is fast. They have a little service button at each table. The menus may seem a bit overwhelming for first timers but I just looked at the pictures on the walls and included in the menu to help me decide.

I gave him the benefit of the doubt several times knowing that he may be busy or it maybe because of the holidays but it NEVER improved. It's nothing personal it is just not the way I would handle a relationship between a client and myself. My closing date changed and no one bothered to tell me or inform me why. I had to send out a very blunt and strongly worded email on Christmas Day because no one seemed to care about me and my first home purchase. I've worked in real estate industry before so I get what it's like. I understand things happen and things change last minute. It is just they way things will go sometimes but not returning a call text or email for several days is simply unacceptable.

There are so many examples of things that went wrong that could have been avoided or at least give me more of a notice before I had to do something. I felt bad for Jonathan for having to break bad news to me over and over again for things like something is going to cost more money or the appraisal had to be paid for up front and it's not going to be billed to escrow like I was told it I have to take an 8 hour online class (which of course cost more money) and only have 24 hours to do it.

The rest of the dishes were fine, but without the depth of flavor I've come to expect at other Spanish tapas spots I've visited.\n\nService was marginal at best.  Our server provided pretty curt responses to our inquiries about the menu; it almost seemed like we were somewhat of an inconvenience by coming out for dinner that evening.  I was particularly disappointed in the staff's inability to explain more about the dishes we ordered, especially when it came to the meat and cheese plates.

When the food arrived, mostly they look good but I was disappointed about the small portion of the chicken on my dish compare to other table.  I tried all my friends' food (crab cake benny, classic breakfast, french toast) and they all tasted average.  Overall, the food look better than it tasted.  One good experience I had is the service.

The worst food poisoning ever. \n\nMy review will be in 2 parts, the first for the actual food. The second for the day after. \n\nFor the record, I've been eating at Tokyo house roughly 15 years. I work close by, and I've always lived in driving distance. I've LOVED this place since a kid. It use to be run by a little old man and his wife, but is now run by new owners... This is when everything has changed.\n\nI went here last week and ordered Beef Yakisoba, a normal go to for me. I normally ask for it spicy but went regular this time around. Normally I'm asked if I'd like rice or not (which I normally decline as the dish is suppose to be all noodles) I received my food, where immediately I knew something was different. Since there was new owners, I figured there was a new cook and maybe things have just changed. I gave it a shot..... and I've never regretted a decision so much in my life. \n\nThe normal dark consistency of the noodles wasn't there, it was a lite sauce lacking any real vegetables or meat for that matter. In total I counted 7 small pieces of beef. They added rice without asking (eh whatever) but on top of that the portions have changed fairly drastically from what it use to be. I get cutting back on portion sizes, but meat and vegetables to? What am I really paying for here? 8$ for just a bowl of noodles? The taste itself was a little sour, almost not pleasant but I kept going to see if it would grow on me. Inside of the dish were water chestnuts, which were never in before and I enjoy them so no complaints. However biting into them was sour, almost like they were opened and sitting out over night. I stopped with the food about half way through and tossed it in the trash. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: TMI\n\nThe following day 6am strikes me with urgency. My bodys way of letting me know to get up now before you crap the bed. The hail storm of watery half solid chunks of feces spewed from my body with such force the water splashed around in the bowl. I knew today would be a bad day, I call out of a work and attempt to go back to sleep. \n\nWithin 30 minutes I'm up again, my body calling me back to the sacred holy ground which is my toilet. The only way to describe what was happening in there was this... Imagine your a kid again in the pool and you fill up one of those water launchers and then you try to push it out with all your force. At this point I get in the shower and after I try to go back to sleep again.\n\n30 Minutes goes by again, at this point I'm up. As I'm sitting on the toilet for round 3, the urge to puke begins. As I'm bent over the tub praying to Jesus I puke already a sensation rushes down to my sphincter. I jump into the shower and prepare for the worst. Thats when it all happens. Those convulsions you get from puking when you tense up so much you can't control the rest of your body. I release from both ends with such force. I turn on the water and it hits my back like cold little knives cutting my skin. I start to see the remains of one end of my body flow down the drain. I immediately begin to puke again. \n\nThe rest of the day was constantly running back and forth from the bathroom, dry heves, and a fever. I could of went more into detail but I figured I'd spare you all the hardship.\n\nI will never be going back to this restaurant. 15 years and you trying to cut corners on your food has lost you a loyal customer.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Really cute coffee shop!

I'm closer to 40 than 30, so we were looking to have \"grown-up fun,\" as opposed to the usual Vegas shenanigans. (though it looks like those can be found EVERYWHERE). We've also stayed all over the Strip- from the Four Seasons  and Wynn to the Luxor and MGM Grand, so were excited to try something new and upscale.\n\nWe had a Studio room with a fountain view that overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the Strip and it was amazing. The room was great-- the perfect size- and we liked the open floorplan. The decor is lovely and we felt very at home and comfortable for the three days we spent there. Definitely book a room on a higher floor-- we were on 33 and I think I wouldn't want to be lower than 27ish for the view we had.\n\nThe check-in/out/front desk/concierge staff were all great-- as were our waiters in all of the restos where we dined. Everyone was VERY attentive and it seemed like that was a priority throughout the resort, sans the doormen- of which I actually never saw one (maybe they dont have??)\n\nWe got drinks at the Chandelier bar, which is fun and a very cool, unique idea. The casino is actually pretty small, but it was fun and much nicer than the places that seem to go on forever. They have interesting art to look at and the LED screen pillars in the lobby are a very cool touch.\n\nWe had an AMAZING dinner at Scarpetta. The food and wine were delicious and the service was impeccable. I LOVED our waiter!! We had a table for two right in the window facing the same Bellagio fountain-- I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner. I will definitely go back the next time we visit LV.\n\nWe grabbed a quick lunch at the hidden pizza place one day-- and it was DELISH. there was a long line out the door and no sign marking the place-- and you could see why. it's a definite must for anyone staying at the hotel... We had lunch at Holstein's the following day- which was a good place to go if you want upscale diner food. I'm a Veggie, so the burgers (which are apparently pretty good)- were wasted on me- but my onion rings and milkshake were quite tasty. :)\n\nWe spent one afternoon at the Spa and Hammam. I visit spas around the world and consider myself an aficionado of sorts, so was a bit surprised that I was disappointed with this one in the end. The decor is ok and the staff mixed-- the girls in the locker room couldn't have cared less as it related to \"service\" and jammed everyone visiting the spa into one area of the locker room so we were all on top of one another. My husband and I BOTH noted that they also should have a clock or two in the spa, so you know how much time you have before your treatment appointment. I was also given the wrong size shoes and robe and it was also VERY messy-- there were open/used lockers and towels dropped on the floor or draped on doors in every corner, as well as an overflowing wastebasket of water bottles in the jacuzzi area. kind of gross...  we got a couples treatment in the Hammam, which was actually beautiful inside. the room itself felt very natural and modern at the same time and the heated stone is VERY cool. Our treatment (Red Flower Hammam Experience or something like that) wasn't at all what I expected from the written or verbal description I received (a bit lack-lustre) and IF we were to go back (which I probably wouldn't)- I'd opt for a massage with an add on scrub instead. I hate leaving disappointed and not relaxed-- especially after dropping $700 in about 2 hours- but hey, it was an experience and you have to try to know.\n\nthe only other fault we found with our otherwise delightful Cosmo experience is the \"dog-friendliness\" of the hotel. As all of their commercials feature Great Danes (and other animals), we assumed it was a dog friendly hotel. It turns out it is- if your dog weighs less than 20lbs. Ours is about 10lbs, so it was fine (though I still think it's weird they show giant dogs in the elevator in those spots!)-- but the hotel ISN'T really dog-FRIENDLY. The Four Seasons and W chains offer in-room services and even menus for dogs-- they have dog beds, bowls, toys and leashes waiting in your room when you arrive or send them up- and offer pet-sitting and special treats, etc.-- but there was NOTHING at the Cosmo. As its Vegas, and there's nowhere to really TAKE your dog \"outside\"- they do have a dog run-- it's about 3ft wide and 10ft long. With as much real-estate that this place has dedicated to everything, we were REALLY surprised that they didn't have a grassy area where guests could sit and play with their dogs-- even a 12x12ft space would do, considering the dog size restrictions. Actually-- it would be GENIUS if they had a place that was a dog store, daycare, grooming and \"park\" area, as people pay big bucks for these services and I'm sure clients and locals alike would LOVE it.\n\nAnyway-- that's my novel of a review on our stay at the Cosmopolitan... all in all, I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10.", "stars": 4.0}, {"text": "I was hoping to finally try this place and then I see people outside taking orders in over 110 degree weather not ok.

She didn't say anything else about it until she finished curling it and said she wanted me to look at it because she really didn't think I'd want it up.  It was strange.  Don't get me wrong - my hair looked great.  There were lots of big curls.  I agreed to leave it down, but mostly because she didn't seem into it.\n\nThe girl doing one of my cousin's hair seemed to hate working there.  We were sitting right next to each other, so I asked them both if they get tired of doing people's hair all day.

I had been going to Valerie at the Silverado location, but today I went to Corinne here at North Rainbow. BIG MISTAKE! I went because I had a lunch break at work and my brows needed to be waxed. I didn't realize I already had an appointment with Valerie tomorrow. I thought it was next week - coincidentally she left a message while I was getting the worst wax of my life. I will never return to Corinne again.\n\nI got there a little after 12:00 PM, and I was told that the Benefit employee was supposed to be there already. I waited about 10 minutes, and Corinne finally arrived. She told me to wait in the chair because she had to finish her own makeup. She said she dropped her Gimme Brow in the car and couldn't find it. She seemed very upset by this, and she said it was her favorite product. She said one of her brows was unfinished. She looked fine to me. \n\nShe used the Gimme Brow sampler without using a new applicator (she used the one on the sampler). She told me she was late because she had to take her boyfriend to work as his own car was in the shop. Then she got the waxing stuff set up. She appeared to be moving in slow motion, slowly grabbing wooden sticks and cotton-tipped applicators from the storage container. It took her about three attempts to get the wooden sticks out of the container (they weren't packed tightly or anything). It seemed a little off, but I figured she was in no rush as she was apparently late for work. Hindsight is 20/20, and I am now actually worried she was under the influence while performing my service.\n\nI told Corinne that I had been growing my eyebrows for the past 4-5 months, and that Valerie said they had been growing in nicely. I complimented Corinne on her own eyebrows and thought I was in good hands (since I liked her own eyebrows a lot). She never asked me to sign a liability waver, which I recall signing with Valerie every time.\n\nAs she waxed my eyebrows, she kept saying that \"everything I do has a purpose\" and \"don't touch your eyebrows between waxes.\" She said she was \"starting from scratch,\" which gave me pause because I have been going to Valerie for 4-5 months. If I have that much regrowth, why is Corinne making such a big deal out of it? I felt like she was lecturing me about how to maintain my eyebrows. I told her multiple times that I don't do any tweezing between visits, and that I have even bumped up my appointments in the past to accommodate fast growth.\n\nCorinne seemed inexperienced, as her motions were not very fluid. She was very rough with every touch, even when just simply cleaning. It hurt. However, if it looked good in the end, I was willing to deal with some roughness. After all, waxing isn't exactly a pleasurable thing. Unfortunately, my brows look terrible.\n\nTowards the end, I mentioned I had a scar on the right eyebrow. It has never affected the outcome, and I thought it was irrelevant since I was growing out my brows. The scar is only visible when my brows are thinner, and even then it doesn't look bad. Corinne then scolded me and said \"you really need to be telling people that because I could have really messed things up.\" She then told be about a woman with bushy eyebrows and a big, noticeable scar. She lectured me for about 5 minutes. As a professional, she should ask that information if it is THAT important. Again, I didn't volunteer this information because the goal is to be GROWING my brows, not making them thinner. \n\nThis is when I really got the impression that she is young, immature, and inexperienced. Nevertheless, I know there are some high school students out there that tweeze their own eyebrows to perfection. All I cared about was the end result.\n\nShe did at least put on some eyebrow products to make them presentable, but that really would not have been necessary if she had done what I asked in the first place. She used the Gimme Brow sampler on me, which she had previously used on herself.\n\nI paid $20 for the service and left a $5 tip (even when I receive bad service, I have a hard time not leaving a tip), but I was not able to fully evaluate just how bad things were until I got home and removed all of the product she put on my skin and brows. I HAVE NEVER HAD BROWS THIS THIN. I have had some unsatisfactory wax jobs over the last decade, but this is by far the worse. My brows are also uneven. She took an unbelievable amount of hair, approximately 40%! I have pictures that I just took; it is just unbelievable how much hair she removed.\n\nI have never been so dissatisfied with a service before, and this is my first Yelp review.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "This laundry center always is here and I'm thankful especially when your water is out", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Well they certainly slapped this store together in a hurry.

The chicken had good seasoning and was cooked properly, so that was better. My boyfriend got the trio dish which came with a chicken enchilada (okay-basically a pile of mush without much flavor), a pork tamale (disgusting . . . really disgusting. It looked identical to the enchilada, but I can't even describe how gross it was), and a mini taco (okay).  \n\nThey forgot our corn tortillas and we asked or server, but then forgot and we had to remind her again ten minutes later once we could finally flag her down.

Further, treating the root cause of these issues is VERY time consuming and extremely expensive, and nothing of quality is covered by insurance.  That's not Dr. Sparks' fault and is not why I am leaving a mediocre review.  I am actually disappointed with the subtle lack of mutual respect and human connection that I came to find intolerable in working with her for 20 months.  It was not blatant, she was not rude,  but she did not listen or hear me in any way.\n\nShe suggested a lot of great things that jived with the hundreds of hours of research that I was doing on my condition, but when I brought up major points that were hitting my intuition (I.e. parasites, cavitation infections, the order in which we are treating microbes), I was repeatedly dismissed.  Then she learns about parasites and BAM, turns out I do have a major parasite issue that should have treated FIRST.  That alone set me back a year in my healing.  \n\nThe final straw in me switching practitioners was when I asked her again about a specific muscle pain that I was having (despite seeing two myofascial specialists and two energy healers) and was told that it was due to trapped emotions and that \"she knows I have my energy people but I have not seen hers\".  Turns out the pain was due to the untreated parasites.  I do believe trapped emotions can cause pain, but I am competent enough as an individual to find my own specialists and determine when a specific modality has reached its peak of effectiveness.  Problem is, I don't believe she thinks her patients are competent or know their own bodies.\n\nTreating major illness is very scary as one faces years of pain, loss and extreme expense.  I was repeatedly told that fear was a \"negative human trait\" that puts a damper on the immune system.  Absolutely true about immunity, but statements like that make a patient (myself included) feel shame and, ironically, more fear.  I was also told to see a life coach, and when I told her I have an excellent therapist, she literally rolled her eyes.  Since I am a therapist myself, I was a bit surprised and hurt by that response.\n\nIf you have Lyme and live in Vegas, Dr. Sparks is your best in-person option.

She spoke with the Assistant manager over the phone who told her that she could go ahead and rent me an overnight vehicle. I went back to my car to let my boyfriend know what was going on. As I returned into the store the lady I had been dealing with sent me over to another cashier to take care of this. This new lady has no clue about what I needed assistance with and has to ask the lady who sent me to her. While they are talking things over they then start doubting whether it will be okay to rent me the van and the new lady calls someone ( the assistant manager ) who comes to front right away and now says they will not be renting me the vehicle for overnight due to a recent situation that happen with one of the vehicles. I got really pissed off because the assistant manager switched up his decision and I had waisted valuable time there walking away without a truck. It basically was up to the assistant manager to decide if he wanted to allow a truck being rented for overnight. When the first cashier called him he should not have told her it was okay to rent me the truck for overnight. That particular location will never get my business again. They were all a bunch of....

We also had the chicken wings, fried calamari, and jalape\u00f1o poppers for apps. Each dish was $4 with the exception of the mushrooms ($2). The meats were really good quality, and my favorite was the bulgogi which was really tender and had a great marinade. The chicken wings were average, crispy but pretty bland. The poppers were filled with cream cheese and salmon with a tempura batter. The calamari were okay as well, but the breading was disappointingly flavorless, much like the chicken wings. The dipping sauce that came with it added some much needed flavor to the dish.\n\nThe service was relatively spotty. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our order quickly.

It came out after we had already ate our entrees, with ranch dressing with blue cheese crumbles on it still.. you would think if they're subbing the blue cheese for ranch they would take off the blue cheese crumbles as well. At this point we just had them sent back to the kitchen since we had already finished eating everything else. The entrees were very very bland, and over priced.

Overall, it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tour.\n\nCommunication is a little spotty at times, but mainly because it's a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint.  After a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls.  \n\nWe signed up for the One Hour Tour.  John picked us up from The Four Seasons Hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the Motor Speedway where they dropped us off next to the Airforce base.  It's about a 30 mins drive. To begin with, I have never driven an ATV before, but I owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle, so I am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle.  However, a few of the gals did not.  \n\nGirls - be smart, not stupid.  Wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer.  It's simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon.  You'll die.  Second, wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body.  Bring a light long sleeved shirt.  The sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply, you'll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms.  Second, wear old tennis shoes. Not TOMS, not Keds, not sandals.  Again, don't be an idiot, you are in the desert on a 4-wheeler.  The pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the engine.\n\nLast, bring a small backpack filled with water, extra sunscreen, ibuprofen, kleenex (i.e. toilet paper), chapstick and a bandana.  While the group gives you a water during the half time break, they only bring enough water for one bottle per person.  It's hot outside and the heat definitely got to me.  I wish I would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirt.\n\nNow, onto the tour.  I thought it was amazing.  The guys are tatted up, smoke and good ole' boys - they know what they are doing.  They did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow.  They also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an ATV.  They warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills.  As you become more comfortable with the ATV,  you  have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time.  They definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful.  They know the area like the back of their dry, tan hands and do their job well.\n\nHonestly, a one hour would have sufficed for me, as it's hot and physically exhausting, but we winded up riding two hours.  I'm not complaining, it was great fun, but for a retreat recreation I am planning in September, I would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding.  Also, your gas is in what looks like a gear shift on your right handle bar, it's a lot of strain to your right hand - it doesn't work like a motorcycle.  So be prepared for some terrible texting, post tour.\n\nI winded up flying over a \"Witch's Eye\" and into a dune, causing me to almost flip over the handlebars.  I didn't, but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar.  It left a nasty bruise, cut and whiplash, but it was all worth it.  The staff was great - they made sure I was OK, gave me water and asked several times if I wanted to stop and go back.  I assured them I was OK, and while I definitely felt it the next day...and today...I am still so happy I did the tour.  It was great to get out into the desert, out of the strip, see the jets fly above you and meet some new people. I definitely would recommend this group and Casey as your guide.

But I ate it, because we were day drinking and needed something.  and I ate the next one, to make a point.  They steered clear of us after bringing us the second pizza, probably so they didn't have to bring us another pizza.  \n\nThey did however slip the bill to us about halfway through the movie.  Well, I guess I am done ordering?  Do I really need to dig in my purse and miss some of the movie to get you payment so soon?

I played some craps and was told that the all the tables would be closing at 10am on Monday.  Late Saturday night I was back with some friends who wanted to get some chips and one last visit and just to be thorough I asked again about the closing and got the same info. Sunday night I decide to turn in early (1am) so that I wouldn't oversleep and could be in Sahara by 9am.  I notice from the parking garage and walking into the casino that things are not very busy so I'm feeling pretty good about my chances of being the last roller as I was a little concerned that it was going to be super crowded and nearly impossible to get on to any table game.

The cashier wasn't selling chips and the only other tables (BJ) were usually full.\n\nI do appreciate that the pit supervisor let us know when there were 3 spins left so that we wouldn't be blindsided that the game was over.  On the final spin I go all in (you have to right? I was the only one who did though).  The prior spin winning # was 19 so I'm on red, odd and 5 individual #s including the last winning #.

Please note that this review does not necessarily reflect their business in normal operations. \n\nThe previous table hadn't left yet and we ended up waiting 25 minutes before being seated. A manager asked the table to leave as he had mentioned to them when they arrived late that they would need to leave when the next table arrived - I assume they were probably still eating when we got there. If seating time is limited, customers should be informed of such at seating or when the reservation is taken. While we did get a brief apology for the late seating, nothing more was done to make up for it.\n\nPricing of this restaurant is hefty for izakaya fair (understandable given their high quality ingredients and resources), which is one of the reasons I wanted to take advantage of big taste. I opted for the bison tataki and the rest of the menu consisted of snapper bone miso soup, scallop isoyaki, trout roe nigiri,  assorted yakitori and bone marrow, and a double chocolate torte with matcha ice cream. \n\nThe tataki had nice yuzu, ponzu, and roasted garlic flavours but was too salty. The miso soup was rich and buttery but also a tad too salty. The scallop and nigiri were both very nice though the scallop portion was small. \n\nThe yakitori was pretty good and came with a soy and egg yolk based dip. The chicken hearts and bone marrow came together, and thankfully, rice comes with this course as well. It's much needed to help carry the heavy and rich marrow and salty marinades. \n\nDessert was rich, with almost a ganache style torte that was salted. The black tea caramel was delicious I thought. The matcha ice cream with each bite is a must to balance the sweetness. \n\nOverall, the meal was very heavy, salty, and not well balanced like a Japanese set course menu should be. If I did it again i would choose the sashimi over the bison tataki to help balance the meal more, but really they were just missing vegetables entirely so a balance would be hard to find. Individually, I did enjoy the courses though they do need to ease up on  the salt. Japanese flavours are typically more subtle than what I found here. I should mention that I didn't complain to the server, since it was so busy, but I'm sure if I had that they would likely have done something about it. In this respect, it's my fault for not saying anything. \n\nLastly, we had asked about parking when we were waiting and the hostess mentioned they could validate our parking ticket. After we were done paying our bill we discovered that validation could only take place before the bill is paid since they take it off... but the server never asked. Instead of giving us the $6 parking fee, the server said she could just give us $5 out of her purse, like she was doing us a favour. I know she tried to smile about it, but I wasn't convinced. \n\nOverall, not particularly impressed for the money we spent ($200 after 15% tip).

When she confronted the server and asked if it came with the rice and beans the server said something along the lines of \"oh I thought you didn't want that too\" even though the order was repeated twice. So of course the server made a mistake and ask if we would want it on the side which we agreed to, a couple of minutes later there were two medium sized bowls: one filled with rice and and the other filled with beans with two tortilla chips on the top. \n\nI must say my overall experience would be a \"meh\" would I recommend Julio's?

About 6 different kinds of chutney, some salads, and a good 10 other dishes to eat with rice or naan. There was no naan by the buffet, but a basket was brought out fresh for our table.\n\nFood lesson: Papadum. I was never really sure what to do with these oversized, ultra thin and crispy chips, so I'd break off a piece and dip it in a chutney. Turns out you're supposed to mix your chutney with rice, eat a forkful of it and then take a bite of your papadum. Another piece I didn't know was to tear off a piece of naan and use it to scoop up some of your food, kind of like a mini taco, rather than using it as a bread shovel (food shovel? Smooth Wendy..).\n\nOverall impression: The service was spot on 4 stars. Our server came back periodically, kept our water glasses filled and was all around just a pleasant fellow to have serving us. The buffet didn't impress me much, it was ok, but the $18.95 we paid seemed a little steep for what we were getting.\n\nSince my visit, a few friends have commented about how good the food is off the menu, so if you're thinking of heading in, perhaps do that and skip the buffet.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "I only gave one star because it's required.

Where are my chips and salsa? Oh, we have to order them? Hmmm... I was slightly suspicious. I politely declined the popcorn and perused the drink list. The list looked good! My husband and I both wanted to try something different - I got the blueberry mojito and he ordered a fresh mango margarita with salt. Forever and ever later, our drinks arrived. Mine was fine. Just fine. His drink tasted like they had mashed up some frozen mango and it had thawed in his drink. It also did not come rimmed with anything. Small detail, but still... \n\nWe ordered the guacamole trio as an appetizer. Whoa. A ton of guacamole. We probably should have asked another couple to sit with us and help us eat it. The guacamole concept, three different guacs, all a little bit different, is a great idea. Unfortunately, it tasted like pre-made guacamole that each had a little bit of something mixed in at the last minute. Totally disappointed. The chips were ok but also nothing amazing. \n\nOur meals were fine. Nothing exciting. My husband ordered three different tacos - he said the pork one was excellent, the other two were pretty blah. I also ordered a fish taco and it was ok. Nothing stellar. \n\nAll in all, our entire experience took less than an hour. Our server was super nice, the bar was neat and clean and cool.

I was skeptical but they're the \"pros\" so I agreed to the repair since I was made to believe that would fix the issue. I came back a bit later to show them that the noise still persisted and he said they couldn't find anything wrong with it. I was even directing them in the right path but I think pride took over and he wouldn't listen.\n\nGreg got kept denying responsibility and even got combative. Greg kept repeatedly exclaiming \"I DONT REMEMBER SHIT! I DONT REMEMBER SHIT!\" as I tried to explain to him the history of the repairs in his shop so he can get a better understanding of my problem and how their solution didn't fix it.  This visit left me $494.35 out and into Greg's pocket because Greg just likes to throw parts at cars in a \"hail mary\" attempt to see if it fixes the issue. He even said they test ran the car and the noise was gone.\n\nNeedless to say, I got the job I assumed my car needed at another repair shop and guess what, Greg, the noise is GONE!! All it needed was new brake pads and a new front left rotor... lol. ALSO FOR WAY CHEAPER! Greg was trying to scam me again $501.18 to fix the issue he should have fixed the FIRST time. Greg even tried to tell me it was a new noise when I clearly wrote in their check in forms the previous time to check a noise in the front left tire of the car. He accused me of being a liar and I reminded him that I wrote that on the receipts. So we went and checked. When I asked to see them he said \"You should have your own copies!\" He was reluctant to show me the proof but eventually gave in and..lo and behold. I was right..it wasn't a new noise.\n\nAnyway, I will share with you a youtube video. The first 2 minutes go into detail of how a car's brakes work since apparently you didn't know.

He kept emphasizing how he and his shop are honest, but so far it seems not. Also, they WILL NOT correct their mistake. So save yourself the trouble and look for a REAL mechanic.\n\n\nI will also write another review on the experience prior to this one.

Still, our estimate was 7 hours, one truckload and $1000 OVER the in home estimate. \n\nWe spoke w/Chris about inventorying our items for storage, wiling to pay the extra cost.

They assured us all items would be wrapped once at the storage.\n\nThen the bill came for the 1st month of storage, & was much higher than agreed upon. Chris claims he \"miscalculated\" the amount of storage we'd need, so he'd charged more. At this point they have our things, and we have no choice but to pay. \n\nMove in day, the real disaster begins. They show up w/a small truck & begin running through the house, talking about how they have another job to get to. They were literally throwing things and running into each other. We had friends over helping and professionals doing remodeling. They were shocked at the chaos and lack of care with our items. \n\nBoxes started coming in that were discolored and looked wet.

Never wrapped, brown dirt soaking up the sides, bugs & grass, 3 sets of black, greasy handprints on the sides. One man decides to wrangle it himself, and right in front of us, drags it on the pavement, tearing it. He tells us to get an estimate.\n\n2nd small truck arrives and begins unloading SOMEONE ELSE'S ITEMS. Boxes and furniture. We're horrified, as Chris guaranteed our things would never be with someone else's. Half the truck was full of other people's items. So they have to leave again, to get our things. The storage unit is 7 miles from our house and they were gone for 3 hours. We start calling and they said they \"had a lot to do\". When they finally came back at 8:30pm, the head mover was completely soaked. Clearly they'd been doing another job again, the one the crew kept referencing that morning. \n\nAt 8:45pm, he walked in w/our dining room table, broken in half, assuring that Chris already knew and \"it would be taken care of\". We just needed to get estimates & they would handle it. \n\nAs they left w/payment in hand, the head mover drops the bomb that they actually hadn't brought everything. There was a bedroom set & 2 other beds still in storage.($3000 dollars worth of furniture) He said he'd bring them the next morning. Of course we never heard from him. 6 calls to Chris & 3 days later, we finally got the rest of our furniture. \n\nAs damages were discovered,Chris kept saying to get estimates. Per the contract, repair/replacement estimates must be submitted w/in 30 days. We complied. 9 weeks and at least 20 phone calls later (most unanswered, as they do indeed dodge phone calls. If you call from a different number they do pick up) we received $120.00, stating we hadn't opted for the extra insurance. They paid $.60 per pound per article. It's critical to note, if you opt for extra insurance, there's a $500 deductible. They've basically insured themselves to treat your items w/no care whatsoever. Also, what's this game Chris continually plays w/having customers \"obtain estimates\"? Obviously an attempt to hold off paying their debts. When questioned about replacing the candles, another 4 calls & a week later, a check arrived to cover the candles.

From the moment he called to say he was on his way to the end of the job he handled him self with excellent customer service and professionalism. He went above and beyond with his work and we are extremely grateful for honest , hard-working  techs such as him. \n\nI also only have wonderful things to say about two women that called to schedule our two separate problems.  They too were very detailed in their conversation when scheduling our appointments for plumbing and the other for appliances. They stated they would follow up before the end of the day to give me more up to date info and they did just that. Their tone was friendly and both were extremely knowledgeable and helpful when I had many questions. \n\n\nMy not so great experience came with the second tech that was sent to our home to repair our dishwasher and dryer. My first issue was that he was scheduled to come between 10am and 2pm. It was after 1pm and we had not received any info on his ETA. Suddenly a CSR calls and states that the tech said he called us and was unable to reach us. We had no missed calls. Tech also stated that he was AT our home and we were not there.  Not true. We made sure to be home all day for that very reason, we understand why they give a 4 hour window. When we told the CSR we were home he said he was outside.  We waited outside for him for 10minutes before he even showed up.\n Giving false information is very unprofessional.  Upon his arrival, he was not pleasant and or personable.  He was able to fix our dishwasher but not our dryer. The information he gave to us was that we likely had a clog in our vent and he would have to have another tech come out and take a look at it. We should be receiving a call that evening or or next business day to schedule. \n\nI Didn't receive a call that evening or next day. I followed up the next day (day 2 ) to see what the status was and I was on hold for 18 minutes . 10 of those 18 minutes were me listening to a repetitive message saying that my call was important and I should be speaking with a rep in about one minute. After someone finally picked up , I was on hold for an additional 8 minutes on your typical hold music (not as annoying as the previous recording ).\n\n Come to find out the tech notes stated that we needed our vents cleaned (something that's not covered in our warranty which I completely understand) and that the job was done. My frustration was he lied to begin with before arriving at our home and gave us completely different info to us directly vs what his notes stated on the work order. I hope that when dealing with this company in the future the tech be honest and if he is in doubt , that he check with the company before saying one thing to the customer but reporting the complete opposite to his company.  \n\nOn a separate occasion, we called in to report an issue with our AC. An issue that we faced the previous year and were told it was not something they could fix. When the AC continued to leak causing more cosmetic  damage but most importantly, a huge safety concern, as our sons celling was starting to hang, we reached out to our friend who is  a certified HVAC teach. He went into our attic and instantly found the issue. It was just a matter of removing a cap that was covering a pipe which in turn was backing up the pipes causing a leak. I let that one go and I did so solely on the fact that I didn't have to pay my co pay since the tech didn't actually fix anything on his appointment. \n\nFast forward to 2018 and now we are having the same exact issue. Same exact area, same room and we are leaking. Call in my work order and the guy they send takes a look at the unit outside, a look at our sons room (which, btw has a trash bag taped to it to trap the water its leaking) and peaks into our attic. He never actually steps into it. He then says to us that he's unable to complete the repair for what ever reason. He steps out to his car and call makes a call to what we can only assume is his work.\n\nWe get on the phone to them simultaneously and let them know we would not be paying for a damm thing because the tech made no effort to even locate what was causing the actual problem.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "I order the chicken empanadas, the guava juice and the Steelers arepa.

It's not like we are just paying cover charge, or on a VIP list with no expense.  We are paying for a VIP table and had these reservations.  The bouncers are making up reasons until one group goes by us and I say \"What is the deal?\" and the bouncer responds \"he's spending a lot of money\".  What?!!!!  Are you serious?  SO ARE WE! I found out his name is Jesse.  He tried to make up for it later when he found out I had reservations, but again - a little too late buddy.  I flipped my lid but remained calm because this party was about my friend's bachelorette and wasn't about to ruin it by causing a scene.  \n\nSo I start texting my VIP host...the folks at ARIA still couldn't get it.  Apparently the rude girl at the top had confused our reservations and they just gave us tickets, so we were getting the cheap bitch treatment.  Eventually, someone got the notice that we were paying citizens and finally walked us to our table, but not before telling us they were getting the \"tables ready\" still. What a joke - we ALL KNOW the tables are never ready until you get there...Then - they give us a table by the exit where you can't see a DAMN thing.

I had to contact them because nobody contacted me to tell me that the bracelet was in, if it could be repaired. Nothing. The clerk that answered the phone was snide and rude. Telling me that they won't repair it because of the missing link. Had it not fallen apart, I would have had that part. For something that was purchased less than 6 months prior, it shouldn't have fallen apart like this. I asked to have a manager call me back.

I called after business hours and left a message for the on call vet, Dr. Dutton on the 'non-emergency' line. I just wanted to find out if there were symptoms to be looking for. The Dr. never returned my call. The next morning and a totally unconcerned receptionist told me there were no same day appointments, 1 appointment the next day in mid-afternoon (when I'm at work) and a few the 2nd day in the morning.\nThe 2nd day appt was made and I went in to see Dr. Brandt who was fairly prompt and examed Josie, gave her a 72 hour vitamin med to help her bowels and sent us off. \n\nLast night I got home to a cat with one eye almost completely shut and weeping, with green mucus, a very red third eyelid. Scary. I knew I had to wait until 7AM to call, because BCVC doesn't take messages, and clearly the on call vets don't give a shit, so I got up this morning and just brought her in at 7, hoping they could spare a minute to look at my cat's freaky eye problem. There was no one else in the waiting room (of course) when I arrived, yet the receptionist told me there were no appointments available until 4PM (again when I'm working) and had no interest in letting me see someone now. I asked if they had affiliate clinic recommendations, or a nearby rec at least, and she said no. She did offer to let me leave my cat ALL day in a cage at the clinic so she would be there for the 4PM appointment, but well, my cat can't explain her symptoms to the doctor now can she?\n\nFinally I squeezed the name of an emergency clinic on 40th and Cactus out of her and took off for there. \n\nLook I'm sorry my cat can't get sick on your schedule Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic, but maybe for your next customer (since I won't be returning) you could offer a bit of compassion for an animal in distress.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Everything about this place sucked - I really don't understand how repeating my order 4 times could result in my order still being made wrong.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "I figured I would post this to the Ford site being the east Mesa Nissan dealership was sold but was Earnhardt's! at the time of purchase.\n\nBought a Nissan xterra back in 2008, paid the loan off, received the original loan documents back from the bank, and sure enough after looking at our original loan documents verses the banks, ours was missing paperwork.

The steak was decent, although cooked a little more than I like it.  It was more medium than medium rare.  The tiger shrimp was just slightly overcooked.  The accompanying vegetables were a half of a red pepper and a stalk of asparagus.  The baked potato with the works was nothing special.

Pho Delight achieves this well. \n\nI did try their rice and vermicelli dishes and that's where the differences become more apparent. Pho Delight is Chinese owned and I find the taste of their rice/vermicelli dishes more \"Chinese\" than Viet. The taste is lighter than at Pho Mi 99 in Sauga (Pho Mi 99 is Viet owned). Also, the spring rolls are not as crispy and savory as the Viet versions. \n\nSince it's the closest pho restaurant to my house, I'll probably come again.

I had never felt anything worse in my entire life. I literally felt as though the doctor treated me as though I was nothing but a dollar sign. It was my first baby so i really didn't know any different.\n\nThen i found Dr. Kelley when i was pregnant with my second and i appreciated his get-to-the-point attitude. It was great to just hear it straight. He examined my previous c-section scar and told me it looked very unusual (which immediately followed me bursting into tears because i knew that the previous doctor didn't take his time and possibly didn't care).  I didn't expect Dr. Kelley to hold my hand and tell me everything was going to be ok - instead he explained that he would remove my old scar altogether and make it look better. And he did. \n\nMy second delivery (in 2013) via c-section was a dream compared to the first. I initially went into labor 6 days early on my own to which the triage nurses ended up calling him in the middle of the night and by the time he got there, my contractions subsided but since he was already there, he said \"Let's have a baby!\"  I don't know what he did different but it was practically painless!  I couldn't have been more happy!\n\nMy third (in 2016) was even better. He made sure that I was comfortable while I was in the hospital recovering and even let me leave a day early. \n\nI delivered at Summerlin for each of my kids and Dr. Kelley was amazing for my last two. He may be a little \"cold\" at appointments but it's because he's not there to waste anyone's time. He knows when to lighten up and when to keep it professional and, for me, that's what I need.

I told her I didn't want the razor and she said it wasn't a razor and it was a \"thinner\" and she would only use it a little... I walked out with what I thought was an ok hair cut only to wash it and have it look like a kindergartner had cut it. It was extremely choppy and even my flat iron couldn't make it look decent. I quickly canceled my color for fear of having her ruin the color too. The only problem is I had purchased the yelp deal for $100 and I knew I didn't want to come back to her. I called the salon and asked if I could transfer or gift the groupon because i wasn't pleased with my hair cut. The owner agreed to let me transfer it to my neighbor, told me to come in to have his wife \"fix\" my hair...I didn't want to come in, I was embarrassed but they assured me it was ok and Ashlee wouldn't know. I came in and they proceeded to tell me that Ashlee said I asked for a \"disconnected cut\" and that's why she did it... ummm mind you I don't even know that term. But Ashlee swore I said those word. It was embarrassing and I felt so small yet I let Carol go through and blend it in...I have to admit, she did a really good job blending in the choppy mess with out cutting too much more off.

I tell her what I want and tell her I'm not worried about the rest of it but mostly want a full bang... she says ok and then cuts my hair. She then begins to blow dry it telling me she wants to see how my bangs dry before she cuts more and as she is doing this she blow drys my hair and begins to flat iron it... I didn't ask for a style as I'm going home to 3 small children but too late now. I feel like it's taking forever and tell her, \"you don't need to flat iron my hair I'm going home right after\" but she is pretty much 1/2 way done. Needless to say, the one thing I was most looking forward to, my bangs, does not look right... it keeps parting in the middle and my hair part is always parted on the side but when she cut it, she parted it in the middle so it's being very stubborn. She then hands me the flat iron to see if I can fix it and it still wouldn't sit right (probably not her fault) so I mentioned using water a few times but my whispered plea went unanswered (maybe she didn't have a plain water spray bottle?) she finally finishes and I notice one side of my bangs is longer and keeps going in my eyes so I ask her if it's longer and she says no so i say ok... I walk up to pay and it's $48. I'm pretty sure she charged me for shampoo and style when I specifically said I didn't want them but I pay any way because she did do them. I tipped her 15% cause I wasn't happy with the price unless the prices went up but last time I paid $36 or $38... needless to say I'm in my car and I notice my bangs are uneven. I go home and put water on them and they are still uneven :( I also found a super long price of hair I the back... I feel sad. I wanted to love this place but I feel so dumb. I've lost $55 and have a jacked up hair cut and didn't get on the road until 12:23 and was supposed to have my appointment at 10:30 am! Who takes almost 2 hours for a hair cut? That's just crazy.

My stomach was upset after for a few hours, but, then again, I'm lactose intolerant. \n\nEven though I had a bad experience the first time, I would like to give them a second chance.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "To start with, we went to the Food Truck Friday because this truck was going to be there. Coupled with another truck that we wanted to try, we talked about it for weeks! Keep in mind that I write these reviews not just to help the customers be wise consumers, but also so that business owners can get feedback from customers and gain insight into running their business in the most successful manner. With that said, I struggle with this review. The company has really been well marketed and over hyped! The truck is beautiful and as up to date as possible. The line was extremely long and it took quite a while for food to come out. While waiting in line I noticed that several people were complaining and returning food! I was honestly pretty worried at that point and tried to hear why they were coming back. The complaints were all the same. The lobster rolls they had ordered were supposed to be hot and that the lobster was cold. I asked one lady what was wrong with her food and she told me that it was ice cold in the middle. People were not complaining about the line to order. They were complaining about the wait for their food. There was a huge group of people waiting for food. Suddenly a woman appeared frantically trying to get into the truck's front door which was locked. She had Walmart bags in her arms. I said to my wife that she must have made a Walmart run for Lobster (We were in the parking lot for Sam's Club and next to the Walmart.) I was joking but I think she went to get bread. That's right my \"roll\" was on bread. I would say it was Texas Toast to be exact. So, it was my turn to order. The guy is taking orders from the window which is quite high, and I had trouble hearing him. He used a tablet to have me sign for my debit card. They ask for an optional tip which I find absurd when no one is doing anything worth tipping. They didn't bring my food and as a matter of fact I had to ask for a napkin and a fork. When I went back to get a knife the lady was very nice, but I still wouldn't say it was worthy of even more money. I must admit that I was taken back by the price. I know that lobster can be expensive, but this is extremely expensive for the size of roll you get. It is about double what I think it is worth. Our order did not take too long to get (about 8 minutes). I guess once the cook came back it was easier to pump out food. By the way I watched to see if she washed her hands and she did.  The man called our name over the loud speaker that is useless! I didn't see anyone else go to the window, so I figured it must be mine. Anyway, we got our food and I was shocked at how small it was. My wife and I always split food. I could eat three of these on my own! We each took our two bites and the Lobster is wonderful. It has a wonderful sweet flavor. There was a small line of mayo on the Texas toast that did not make much difference. I would double the mayo but that is me. It was lobster on bread. Well the wait was over and in two bites the meal was over. I looked at my wife and laughed. I said, \"well that was a big bubble buster!\" She said she thought the flavor was great but that the $20 we spent was not worth it. For the record the roll was $16.50 plus tax and tip. I felt a little robbed to be honest. I am the type of person that tips huge amounts for great service and doesn't mind paying a lot of money for quality food and service. In this case it was a bit much. Let's not forget this is a food truck. They don't even have the overhead of a brick and mortar restaurant! They must be making a killing off the name and notoriety, but it will not last for long because I can't imagine too many people will go twice. I know that I would never do it again. I love Shark Tank, and this is good quality lobster, but they better listen to their customers or they won't be around long. Overall, I rate them a 2. Quantity of food 1, Service 3, Price point 1, Quality of food 5.", "stars": 2.0}]

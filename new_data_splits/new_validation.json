Oysters are natures art and don't require anyone adding to it. When you add that oil it coats the sea brine - oil and salt don't mix in this case.\n\nBecareful with the signature slaw. It seemed off compared to last time. Perhaps some of the ingediates sat out too long. the taste was great but the textures weren't as crisp as last time when the  taste matched with the texture. the cold and warmer elements make this dish impossible to beat. \n\nThe scallops were perfectly cooked but be careful of the top layer - maybe diffuse it out so that when they are cut the knife can break through instead of push down and squish the scallop below. You also may want to add saffron was or some other spice to the pur\u00e9ed squash to provide a kick since it seemed bland. \n\nThe highlight of the night was the tuna slices. They were perfectly dressed and yet still allowed natures art to be tasted. Excellent dish!!!\n\nWine selection was great and as always a reasonably priced SB was our choice.\n\nService was top of the line and no issues here.\n\nSadly my wife was disappointed which meant that I was disappointed later on that night.

I did and i ended up with a little but of redness on my chest as well but again nothing major.\n\nDay 5 - I walked in and the place was packed. After waiting for 10 mins, I decided I would run some errands and stop back after. When I got back, all the level 3 beds were full so I did the level 4 bed.

It worked out perfectly. i covered my face and chest when they started to get hot like she recommended and came out with out any redness. \n\nDay 7 - My last day. since I had not tried the level 3 bed that is what i had left to do. This time it was a different girl. I told her i wanted to do level 3 and that 7 mins in the level 4 was fine but 8 in the level 2 was too much. So would 7 mins in the 3 be okay. She asked how i liked my lotion and if i wanted to try anything else. Then tried to sell me a package. I told her i wanted to think about it and she was quick to say okay your set in room 3.

We walked in the store and was immediately bombarded with multiple people jumping on us. It was like a car lot. We had to be somewhat rude for them to leave us alone. After finding the couch we wanted a lady came over and helped us pick color and fabric and the different pieces of the sectional we needed to fit are house. After she messed  up the paperwork twice we finally got the couches ordered and paid for ($3,600) later we were told they would be ready in 3-4 weeks but most of the time they arrive sooner. About 2.5 weeks went by and I got the call they were in and would be delivered that night. I was thrilled to finally have new couches and so soon! Well at about 8:00 pm we get the call that the couches were damaged and would not be delivered but someone would call us the next day to let us know what would happen. The next day came and no call so that night I called them and customer service had no clue who I was or what was going on so they said they would have someone call me the next day. Next day came and again no call so I called again and again and again and kept getting the run around. 5 days after my couch was damaged a manager finally called me back to tell me the couches could not be fixed but she could send me a photo of the damage they could not fix and if I wanted the couches with the damage they would give me a small discount lol. I laughed and said I just spent 3,600 on a sectional and no thank you I do not want a damaged couch. She said ok and told me my next option was for them to re order it and wait another 3-4 weeks for it to come in. I asked if they could put a rush shipping on them because of everything we had been dealing with and she agreed. Two days later she called and said the couches would be in on September 28th and that she would call the afternoon of to set up delivery. Well fast forward to today September 28th. I didn't get a call or a text about the couch so I once again called and had to talk to two different people to be told the manufacture is planning on shipping the piece today and it would probably be in around the first week of October!!!!!!! If I had known it would have taken 6 weeks to get a pretty basic sectional I wouldn't have wasted my time with living spaces. Not only are they unorganized but their customer service is the worst I have ever dealt  with!!! Do yourself a favor and save your time, money and energy and go to a real furniture store!  \n\n\nUPDATE: so after I posted this review the social media team reached out to me and had half of my couch delivered a few days later and the rest was delivered the very next day ( surprising what giving a bad yelp review can do) ok so you would think now that I have my couch everything is great! WRONG!!!!!! The piece that was damaged by a driver and needed to be returned is now a different color then the other half of my couch!!! This is real life!! I have waited all this time for couches finally got them and now it looks like I have a checker board for a couch! I reached back out to the person from social media (who has been very nice by the way) and let her know now the couches don't even match and at this point I just want to return them and be done!! I was told I could return them within 7 days but would have to pay a restocking fee of $360.00!!!! I was like WHAT??? I said with everything I have been dealing with for weeks and now a couch that doesn't even match in color the least you could do is return the couches for free  so I can be done with this mess! She said I would need to send in the photos and talk to management and she would let me know. So now I wait. I will be updating once I hear something but for now here is a few photos of my two toned couch \n\n2nd UPDATE 10/7/17\nI can't believe this problem is still not fixed. Ended up getting ahold of someone else in charge and they agreed to give a full refund and pick up the couches. Great news right? Lol not yet! So they had a scheduled pick up for today from 8-3pm. I was given a new tracking number and everything. I rearranged my entire schedule to be home so this could just get taken care of. At 10:00 when I still had not seen my tracking number on the website with a better indication of when they would be here to pick everything up I decided to call to maybe see if I was given the wrong number. Nope the number was correct the problem was the lady that said she would have them pick up Saturday 8-3 never really put the pickup in the computer. Oh my god! I mean really??? Not sure why I expected the pick up to go as planned when nothing else has! Now it's \"for sure\" scheduled for tomorrow 8-3. Fingers crossed they are going to pick it up.

I only saw one waitress handling everyone, but they had no hostess, so I waited to see if anyone was going to take notice or if I aught to just seat myself. She eventually made her way over to me and I opted to sit at the bar.\n\nThe barmaid was very friendly, but you could tell that both she and the waitress were obviously over-worked, and the place was understaffed. She mentioned that the restaurant had only just opened up this past March, so I can understand if it might take a little while for it to find it's feet.\n\nI opted for the Haufbrau Dunkel (nothing to write home about), and saw that while they have a reasonable selection of beers, all they had on draft were the Haufbrau brands. You'd be inclined to think that if you were eating in a German restaurant, they might have a good selection of German beers on draft, not just bottles. Frankly, I can get a Sam Adams in a bottle at a convenient store.\n\nThe interior is nicely decorated with a lot of Om-pa-pa music playing, and I was told that they have an outdoor Biergarten as well, but I didnt check it out.\n\nWhere the place went downhill for me was the food, and moreso what I paid for it:\n\n If I'm getting a sample plate of their wurst and paying $12 for it, I want more than just 5 or six nubby ends of sausages hidden amongst pickles and half a loaf of bread accompanied by a \"beer\" cheese that tasted like someone added Budweiser to some nacho-cheese spread. The Wurst plate seemed more like the Worst-plate!\n\nThe home-made German mustard was exceptional, but it's going to take more than a good condiment to keep this place afloat.\n\nThe Kartoffelpuffel (potato pancakes) were sizeable, but very greasy and lacked flavor. All it would have taken was for the cook to let them rest on some paper-towels while covered to get some of the grease out and actually season the potatoes. It just tasted more like a giant McDonalds hash brown to me. \n\nIt's pretty easy to see that this place is going through some growing pains; they seem understaffed, and while some of the food (namely the Wurst) is good, it is overpriced for the quality. 2 Beer and 2 appetizers was $30 out of pocket for me alone! \n\n I expected a Haufbrau house, and what I got was a bar that serves overpriced, mediocre German food and beer that I could buy at any local liquor store. In summation, I will say that this place has a lot of potential, and moreso that Mentor needs a good German place, but the management needs to take a hard look at their pricing, plate composition, and elevating their food if they want to draw people in and keep them from just going to Das Schnitzel Haus, or the Haufbrau in downtown Cleveland.\n\nOne last criticism: Where are the fucking Germans at anyway?

The space can be somewhat noisy as there are few soft surfaces present.\n\nUnexpectedly, it is more of a cafe than a restaurant.

I had been expecting more of a normal restaurant place, but it doesn't really matter and this is probably more authentic anyways. Besides, you're here for pizza; ambiance is secondary.\n\nAnd the pizza is good. I went with the 'Rossoverde' and it was a great choice. The crust is thin and simple -- crispy where it should be and chewy where it should be, too. The sauce was light, flavorful and savory; in reality, it's little more than crushed tomatoes and its all the better for it. The cheese, prosciutto and sauce were all in balance and the pie was blanketed in arugula; it was as if a salad was served on top. All-around wonderful.\n\nThey have a good sized menu with sauce topped and olive oil topped pizzas, salads, and a fair selection of Italian style beverages like San Pellegrino sodas.

When you factor in the appetizer, dessert, tax and tips its more like $50 bucks per person and if you are in a relationship then the guy usually does the paying so its more like $100 bucks for a 2 person meal and that is pretty pricy for one meal. \n\nHaving said all that I really did enjoy my night at The Keg. Ambiance is really nice and service is top notch. The meal comes with complimentary bread and butter but I still had to try the cheese bread which was amazing.

Where to begin.  We stopped in around 1:30 and it was not that busy, perhaps six tables occupied and two servers working.  An employee told us we could sit anywhere we wanted and someone would bring us menus. The music in the restaurant was on the loud side and not very enjoyable. The selection being played was a male singer screeching at the top of his voice, barely better than Florence Foster Jenkins.  We debated whether to get up and leave but we wanted to try the New Mexican food which we hadn't had in a long time.\n\nAnyhow, back to the service. About 10 minutes after being seated our waiter brought us our menus. We ordered ice tea and the beverages were brought to us right away. My wife and I decided on our selections and then came the wait.  It took in the neighborhood of 10 - 15 minutes before our waiter came back to our table to ask if we were ready to order. We could see him on the other side of the restaurant not doing anything in particular. He would occasionally give us a quick glance and then look away or go tend to his other tables.\n\nMy wife ordered the Sopapillas and I ordered the Carne Adovada Enchiladas.  Our orders were brought to the table in a reasonable period of time.  Our waiter set the food in front of us and then turned around and decided to engage a customer, that was leaving, in a conversation right at the edge of our table. If you ever tried to eat a meal with their rear-ends practically in your face it's not the most appealing way to enjoy a meal. When it looked like they were going to camp out there I had to clear my throat loudly to give them the hint to move on, which they did.  \n\nAt about this time a minor rush came into the restaurant, 3 groups. We were about half way through our meal and the waiter had not stopped by to see how we were doing. It would have been the last time we would have seen our waiter if my wife hadn't flagged him down as he was passing by our table and we had to ask for refills on our ice teas. (What was also interesting at this time is the three groups that came in had several children with them and all of a sudden the music reverted to a much more typical background music you would expect at a restaurant. I don't know if someone was playing a personal favorite when we first came in or the sound track had a few really bad selections.)\n\nNow onto the food.  Both my wife and I really enjoyed our selections. It was exactly as I remembered when we ate a really good restaurant in Albuquerque several years ago. The portions weren't huge but we were not left hungry at the end of the meal. The waiter came by and collected my plate when I had finished. My wife finished her plate a few minutes later and pushed her plate to the edge of the table. The waiter's attention was now solely focused on the new tables he had to wait on. After 10 - 15 minutes my wife and I got tired of waiting for our check so we stood up and waited by our table which is when I'm assuming was a manger came over and asked if we were waiting on our check. Our waiter then got the hint and brought our check to us.  \n\nWe are not sure if we will be back.

Since I've eaten at Jaleo back in my home state, I figured this Jaleo would either be of the same quality or better. I ended up feeling that the tapas back at home were better. Here's what I had:\n\n1. Berenjenas con miel de ca\u00f1a al estilo Malague\u00f1o (Lightly battered eggplant M\u00e1laga style) - This was surprisingly good. It was lightly crispy and slightly sweet. The eggplant was had a great texture where it would melt in your mouth. Nicely done.\n\n2. Ensalada de coles de Bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jam\u00f3n S(errano Warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham) - I am not a fan of brussels sprouts so I didn't enjoy the first couple bites. However, after that, I started to really enjoy this salad and how it mixed salty, sweet, and bitter flavors together. Nicely executed. The pieces of ham were delightful. :)\n\n3. Vieiras con salsa de romesco (Seared scallops with romesco sauce) - This was my FAVORITE of the meal. It was perfectly seared, juicy, and fresh tasting. The sauce complemented the scallops very well. Too bad you only get two pieces. :( Also, lovely presentation.\n\n4. Codorniz a la Catalana (Grilled whole quail with apple pur\u00e9e and pinenuts) - Great flavor. It was juicy but the breast was slightly dry. That didn't bug me though because I imagine it's quite difficult to cook a quail (such a tiny bird!) perfectly. Nice presentation too.\n\n5. Arroz a banda con bogavante (Literally meaning, 'rice apart from lobster,'\nmade with lobster and cuttlefish) - We had the 1/2 lobster. The lobster was succulent (a little sad it didn't have much meat) but the rice itself was incredibly salty. Even in small bites, it tasted very salty. I think they may have accidentally seasoned it too much, but it was difficult to finish the plate. I was also too tired to complain and the dish had such beautiful presentation.\n\nService: Our waiter was a mix of aloof, aggressive, and somewhat helpful. lol. He really pushed to have us order 3-5 tapas per person and specific tapas that he preferred but we really didn't need to eat that much. We also accidentally spilled water over half of the table, and I was surprised that the waiter didn't notice that we had used all our napkins to wipe up the mess before assisting. Rather, someone else (I think busboy) swooped in quickly and helped us out. The waiter then came by with two napkins, gave my husband one replacement napkin while I stared in disbelief as he walked away with the other napkin. He then turned around after about 10 seconds to give me the other napkin in his hand. I'm not quite sure what happened, but I'm thinking maybe the loud music/business of the restaurant made him tired. *shrugs* I do think the busboy provided outstanding service. He was extremely helpful and attentive. I think he came by our table to sincerely check on us more often than the waiter. We also ordered the paella with cuttlefish, not lobster, but the lobster paella arrived at our table. o_O\n\nAtmosphere: This restaurant is VERY LOUD. Mostly from the music that is playing which in turn increases the chatter level of the patrons. The ceiling speakers are everywhere, so there isn't a quieter spot. The decor was beautiful, modern, and festive, and I enjoyed the interactive nature of the restaurant with the few open kitchens.

Back to the story.\n\n My hair was in excellent condition. Shoulder length, dirty blonde with a tiny bit of blonde highlights at the ends that I said I was willing to cut to get rid of. I wanted to be platinum. She tells me \"I don't think I will be able to take you platinum but I will be able to take you close to it.\" I asked why at the time. I dont remember her answer. (I had been waiting to go to platinum till I got to vegas. I had plenty of other salons tell me they could take me platinum no prob). \n SO we start the process. She was nice. She was also second in line after boychuck. I believed in her. I trusted her. 6 hours later she tells me that it was taking longer than she thought. She gives me over to one of the minions that work there to finish the toning. They (two girls) tone my hair. The toner they used was so terrible I had to close my eyes and breathe through my scarf. (made my eyes water and my throat hurt) Weirdest toning experience in my life.\nToning over I'm led back to my chair and I see what they have done. I'm speechless. My hair was orange. I mean orange as in a light mandarin. What the hell. My lady comes back and say's it looks amazing. I smile with clenched teeth. She then cuts my hair as fast as she can. I ask for a bob with it a little longer in the front. She hacks my hair. I leave the salon trying to pretend it is cute. I wanted to hide. It came out to $600. \nI should of went back. I should of asked for a refund or a fix it. I didnt.\nI went home went to a local salon and asked for help. They toned it down and it came out to an odd strawberry blond. It was hell. \n To top it all off, other salon workers kept coming over and saying how good it looked and I started to believe them. (that is until I was by myself and could fully take in the the wreck that was my hair) \nBoychuck was there too and not once did he come by and see how i was doing. I was in his salon for seven hours and he not come and say hi or how's it going, I thought that was a bit odd since every other worker came by.\nDo not waste your money here.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "This is the go-to bar for Toronto FC pre/post drinking and is somewhat of a staple in Liberty Village.

I don't normally like tomato-based sauces, but it was a light sauce, meaning it appeared to be mixed with something, and wasn't too much of a tomato taste.

Located in the Charleston Festival plaza, this new spot is open, appears clean and is decked out with decent looking furniture and several flat screen TV's. 6 of those TV's are home to the menu which features several boba drinks and a decent amount of food options, including bento boxes.\n\nAfter standing around and checking out the menu for a few minutes, the girl behind the counter asked if we had been there before. We had not, so she said they had some suggestions of popular items...which ended up just being two things, the Chrysanthemum Milk Tea and the Ice-Cream Ball Coffee Jelly Milk Tea. Both seemed pretty straight forward, but she didn't bother to explain anything in anyway or offer any other help. I was also disappointed that she just offered the people in front of us a 10% discount for them just opening, but didn't mention the same deal to us. She was nice enough, but the counter service is basically nonexistent for the most part. \n\nI ended up ordering an Oolong Milk Tea with boba and a KungPao Chicken bento box. The bento box is priced just under $9 and includes meat, a side of greens and fried rice. Going off the flavors and textures alone, nothing appeared to be freshly made. The fried rice had virtually no flavor on its own and seemed more like something you'd get out of the freezer. Unfortunately, the chicken was just as bad and had this awful flavor that tasted like burnt soy sauce. Overall it was just a really bad plate of food and I ended up not finishing it. Thankfully my drink was much better and even half price since I ordered a combo meal. The milk tea was flavorful, not overly sweet, and the boba was very decent. A little chewy, but not soggy or slimy.\n\nMy biggest issue with the drinks here is their regular teas. Our 6 year old son has quite possibly the simplest drink order you could make. He gets a plain ole' black iced tea with boba. No sweetener, no flavors, nothing...just tea and boba. When I asked the girl if they offered a tea like that, she said yes and punched his order in. Yet when we got his drink, it had this extremely strong orange flavor and was really sweet. When I took it back and asked if this was right, she said it was and that this was there house tea, but because I ordered unsweetened that's how it tastes. I was confused as she just told me the tea was plain and unsweetened only 5 minutes before that. She offered a generic apology and basically sent me on my way. I didn't bother wasting anymore money on ordering another drink.\n\nAnother strange thing about this place is their neighboring business, the PVP Zone. I'm not sure if the two are co-owned or if they are just partnering up to generate business for each other, but there is a door inside that goes between the two and people were shuffling in and out constantly. The worst part was this particular guy that I had not seen the whole time during my visit until close to the end. He came in from next door and walked back behind the counter to talk to one of the Jackie Bee employees. While that employee was making a drink in a blender, this guy was standing right next to him constantly running his fingers through his hair. I was too far away to see if anything might be coming off the dudes head, but had I seen that when I walked in, I woulda walked right back out. They let at least 2 other people from next door walk behind the counter and just hang out besides him too. With customers drinks being made in that same area, I think the owners or managers should be paying a lot more attention to who's \"hanging out\" here.\n\nEven with the several boba spots in town, I've been waiting to check out Jackie Bee since I seen the sign a few months ago. Sadly, this was a super disappointing visit and even though the boba was decent enough, I'm not sure I'd come back anytime soon. There's way too many better choices for boba alone, and the food didn't add anything worthwhile. 1.5 stars.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Slow service, pieces are so large, legitimately the size of my palm.

I told her it hadn't come out yet so she went to check. After a minute or so, the hostess peeks her head out from behind the kitchen and looks puzzled as well. So another five minutes or so goes by and finally my wings come out. They are over cooked (which is better than undercooked I guess) and a mix of wings and drums. I ordered drums only.

Once again love their decor and I think they added fish tank. The fish tank is a real beauty. So me and hubby ordered two drinks. I had their Sukho thai mango drink in coconut cup. Deliciously awesome, flavor and presentation, his tom yum martini disgustingly undrinkable. So we ended with another glass of wine. I had spicy tomyum soup that was Luke warm and salty but still pretty good. His coconut milk soup was also Luke warm but flavor was very good. Again like an idiot, I tried Amok steamed in banana leaf (it's my favorite Thai or Cambodian dish) hoping to find a different version from my favorite at la petite Mangue. My man ordered duck in five spices sauce. The duck came out really tough and seemed like it was frozen before. The sauce was really sweet like hoisin. The vegetable was whatever. It was just not good for a $33 entree. He was so excited about duck. My amok smelled way too fishy before the waitress even put it down on the table. I had four pieces of fish in there and the rest was just slimy onion and basil leaves. I think I'm giving up trying this this at any other Asian restaurant. The waiters were nice and friendly and the soups were good but I give up on Sukho thai.

I must assume that \"Minimum\" refers to their level of care for their product and/or customers.\n\nI was on my way to a picnic when I stopped by Beer Minimum to grab a case of Oskar Blues' Mama's Little Yella Pils. Later, while throwing some of the cans in a cooler, I noticed some dried mold on the bottom of the cardboard carry - not a good sign. At the picnic, I noticed that the beer was not quite what I remembered it to be (understatement). The next day, I found the canning date to be April 14, 2009 - almost a year and a half old.\n\nI returned to Beer Minimum with the remaining two six packs today. First they tried to tell me the beer wasn't necessarily bad. Then they tried to give me two replacement six packs of the same, equally old, beer. After a few calls to the owner and some awkward conversation, the lady directed me to Vecenie's Distributor from whom Beer Minimum got the Pils. I reminded her that I got the beer from Beer Minimum. She told me that I could have purchased that beer anywhere. I told her that her computerized records will indicate that I purchased it there.\n\nOne obstacle to my return was that I did not have a receipt. Unfortunately, I don't recall ever even getting a receipt. Anyway, I left the two fetid six packs with the lady at Beer Minimum.\n\nIt must be noted that this is the second time that I have purchased old beer from Beer Minimum. The first time happened about seven years ago when I moved to this area. I successfully returned, but it was still a pain in the....  I had boycotted them for several years as a result. I slowly started going there again because they are the closest distributor to my home.  I always checked the dates and kept the receipts. This time, they caught me off guard. \n\nThe moral of the story:\n\nI cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend this place.

Especially the ones that aren't \"recommended\" by Yelp or the like. I was eager on getting my Canada Goose jacket dry cleaned again after only getting it done once a few years back. I've had my jacket for about 4-5 years and this was my second time getting it cleaned because of my apprehension after my first experience with another dry cleaning company. I inquired with Sporting Life regarding any dry cleaning companies within Toronto they could recommend, and the only company they recommended was Hollanderizing Inc. I looked at their website to see their prices and where they were located and although their prices weren't advertised (I had to email them), I liked how they offered a complimentary pick up and delivery (for $75 they should pick it up and deliver). The price also includes insurance... which after my experience, I am not sure was worth the splurge because upon receiving my jacket this past Monday, I noticed a tear on one of the arms of the jacket. I phoned the next day after the delivery (after further inspection of the jacket) and the woman I spoke with told me the boss/manager would call me back. He called back later in the day and told me to email them pictures of the damaged goods so one of the employees can assess it. I figured it might take them about a day to email or call me back to let me know what they can do for me. However, upon receiving a call back this morning, they basically told me they ALL discussed the situation and decided that bottom line was: it wasn't their fault. Their dry cleaning process \"does not damage jackets nor does the handling of items during transport\". Right. Because when one of your associates picked it up, I had my jacket in a plastic bag for some protection and he said he didn't need the bag because they hang the jackets in the back of the van. I am not a psychic but maybe my jacket got caught on another jacket's zipper or the hanging rack or a loose screw in the van? But no, I am not a psychic. Apparently the \"best\" they can do for me was for ME to drop my jacket off MYSELF and pay $10-15 for them to repair the damage that DEFINITELY WAS NOT THERE before they picked it up. Uhm, why did I pay for insurance though?! Beware! Maybe for a cheaper jacket ($100 or less) you should get it cleaned here if you don't mind getting a damaged jacket back, but for upwards of a $500+ jacket, you might as well clean it yourself (that is, spot cleaning as opposed to putting it in the washer and dryer FYI). I should have just went to the dry cleaning company I went to the first time (the one inside Loblaws on Dupont). The quality of cleaning is the same, and mind you the first time I got it back and I wasn't satisfied with the cleanliness, they happily took it back to re-clean FREE OF CHARGE!

I did think it was strange that you have to go through the bar to reach the dining room, but whatever.  \n\nThe first thing about the service that I found strange was that the hostess who sat us didn't give us menus. She just took us to the table and told us our server would be with us shortly.  At that time, there was only 1 other table seated, and another hostess sat a table next to us a few minutes later (still waiting for the menus).  Then, the server comes out and approaches the other table first.  She gives them menus and then comes to us.  We had to specifically ask for the RW menu, which probably took 10 minutes.  Now, I specifically notated my reservation online that we were going there for RW, so it was a bit confusing that she almost didn't even know what that meant.  It literally took FOREVER to get those menus, which I thought that they should have been giving out standard with their regular menus.  \n\nThe only reason this is even a 3 star review is because the food was so good.  I am 100% positive that our server has never waited a table in her life, because she was so totally clueless.  Although she was very nice, she was very slow and had to be asked for refills numerous times and even forgot my drink order.\n\nSo, it was $50.13 per person for a 3 course meal.  Here is what we ordered:\n\n1st Course: Choice of appetizer\n\nMy friend and I shared the appetizer sampler, which included the taro root fish tacos, the bacon wrapped bacon and egg and the chicken pot pie nuggets.  All were really good, but I think the bacon wrapped bacon and egg was my favorite.  It was brioche toast, topped with pork belly, tomato jam and a sunny side up quail egg.  My egg was over cooked, but still very tasty and the pork belly was really delicious.  Although the fish tacos were tasty, there wasn't really much in the way of fish.  There was 1 little speck of hamachi tuna, but overall it was good.  I am on the fence about the chicken pot pie nuggets.  They tasted exactly like they should, and had plenty of filling, but I just think that the outside crust was a little too hard.  It was weird deciding how to eat it - should I pick it up? Should I try the fork (did this and failed)?  \n\nMy Mom ordered the All Kale Caesar, which was a surprisingly large salad and really good!  I would definitely order that if I went back, and we decided that she got the best \"bang for her buck\" in the appetizer department.\n\n2nd Course: Choice of Entree\n\nI had the Grilled Niman Ranch skirt steak, medium rare.  This was served with Moonen's Tots (on the menu they are Moonen Mash Croquettes) and a small salad of greens and tomatoes with a vinagrette.  The steak was really good, and cooked perfectly.  Whatever marinade they use was a bit sweet and paired perfectly with the smokiness of the grill they use.  For the tots, I was not that impressed.  I am a bit obsessed with tots and not sure these were a favorite of mine, although they were good.  There were more like fried mashed potatoes... and the \"tartar sauce\" that was supposed to be served under them was basically non-existent.  The salad was a salad.  I thought it was a strange accompaniment and should be replaced with some other vegetable. It was not creative and definitely did not flow with the rest of the plate.\n\nMy Mom ordered the Bucket of Crispy Fried Game Hen, which came with Mac + Cheese x 5.  I ended up being very jealous of her selection because it was SO delicious!  I've had game hens before, but never fried, and now I know what I've been missing out on!  These were like chicken wings, very crispy and served with buffalo sauce and ranch for dipping (neither was used).  And the mac n cheese was really tasty as well.  The other diners said it would be in their top 5, but I disagree, although it was very good.\n\n3rd Course: Dessert\n\nThere were only 2 options, and we all ordered fresh baked cookies with milk.  The presentation was awesome - there were about 8 or so cookies on a big wood slab, with an empty glass and a small bottle of milk.  Although the cookies were warm (there were chocolate chip and peanut butter), I highly doubt they were \"fresh baked.\"  \n\nFood wise, everything was good.

Pretty sure they were pork spring rolls.\n\nThe noodles I felt were possibly overcooked. They broke apart completely during the mixing process and it really just ended up being mush, but thats not a huge deal breaker. The \"tangy fish sauce\" that was meant to accompany my bowl either never arrived, or it was the vinegar oil mixture they gave me in a plastic resealable container. Which had next to no taste. And it wasn't very fishy in flavor? So I guessed that wasn't it.\n\nWe also had to ask to order drinks. Because our waiter never asked us. Maybe this is typical for this type of place? I found it a tid bit odd. I didn't bother to ask for the fish sauce that was supposed to come with my meal cause I ended up using chili sauce as a substitute. \n\nI cant really knock a place down for me trying something that really isn't their specialty. You know? I should've had pho instead. But I'm an asshole. Ill try that next time for sure.\n\nMy better half chose a fried noodle dish with chicken and beef. Noodles were over cooked, and he mentioned there wasn't much flavor. Again, they have pho in their name. Not \"noodle salad\". \n\nWe were still peckish, so we talked ourselves into some smoothies. Which...WERE AMAZING. My bearded bear man chose the coffee smoothie sans boba (he hates boba, he thinks its like boogers). I picked the Thai Tea smoothie with boba. I was nervous that they were going to be overly sweet with not much flavor but I was pleasantly surprised. The coffee smoothie tasted like great coffee. And my thai smoothie was perfect. \n\nThe main reason for the less than perfect rating (other than what I mentioned about the food and lack of drinks which were never refilled) was I noticed one of the servers sneezing/coughing constantly...while handling food..and cards..and drinks. If you're sick, stay home if you work in the food industry, otherwise you're a hazard.  \n\nIll come back eventually, but next time Ill be a bit more cautious.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Worst delivery at any hour.

Here is some of what I wrote the company: \n\nThe night started for our party of 11 with an offer to sit in a setting made for 8. After explaining our dilemma, which should have been blatantly obvious to the most inexperienced persons, we were informed to try and \"squeeze in\". We were hoping that was a joke but disappointingly, it was not. This was, of course, after we had confirmed our reservation for 11. Not just confirmed our party of 11 once, not even confirmation of our party of 11 twice, but THREE times! Usually, thats all you get at bat but this horror show is just beginning. Perhaps 30 - 45 mins later, after the restaurant cleared a bit after our 7:30pm reservation, we were offered a larger table. OK, so our night started off poorly (well, lets just say poorly is too mild a word and it would be more appropriately deemed bad already). We had hopes that things would be better as for most of us, this is a first time experience with this restaurant. Next came our experience with finding mold on the bread from your infamous \"all-you-can-eat bread station\". Not quite the dining experience we had hoped for. I would had hopes that some sort of management personnel would have AT LEAST visited us to explain the screw up with our table but having an absence for that event, I would have EXPECTED an IMMEDIATE visit surely after the mold. Unfortunately, our disappointment with Pacini is only beginning. We had insisted to speak with the manager after this. Andy came and explained how he noticed the screw up in the reservation and wondered how they were going to fix that. He explained how he spoken with the \"new\" staff that made such a mistake. I explained how our confirmed came in threes and that I would have presumed that at last one, if not two persons should have seen the mistake. Of course, given that we made our reservation almost a week in advance, one would presume that someone, anyone, should have informed us prior to our arrival. Not even upon our arrival did anyone inform us of the mistake or the dilemma but only an offer of a \"tight squeeze\". I am sure I have never had to \"squeeze in\" even at MacDonalds! The topping to our evening, and I was most certain this HAD to be a feeble attempt at a Candid Camera episode, was that I had the misfortune of ordering the Seafood Linguini. As our party had now been waiting for our dinner way past our patience, I found an unopened mussel in my order. Does the cook know how to cook? Does anyone check the plates before they are sent to the customers? Did the manager have temporary amnesia and forgotten that he had a whole table of already dissatisfied customers? Now I am left wondering if anyone in the whole entire restaurant even trained for their job. After the whole Gong Show we went through, even after speaking with a manager, and as if to add salt to injury, I would have PRESUMED that he or someone, would have at least made an attempt to salvage the rest of our evening. After obviously sending the Seafood Linguini back, I had waited way too long for my remake. The waitress, after about 25 mins, came back to double check that I did not want another order. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING! There wasn't even an attempt to make that right???!!!!! After 25 mins??? I was certain they would have rushed that remake! What more can I say. Dinner time was obviously over. Correction, dessert and after dinner drink and conversation time is obviously over but not even an attempt? That's just wrong for any restaurant to have any customers leave hungry! That should be your number one motto if you do not already have that in your training manual and corporate mission.

A week later I called to get a status on the vehicle and the advisor said he was still waiting on my insurance company to send him the parts. After a phone call from my insurance company to Dodge, my advisor realized he failed to order the parts and we now had to wait for those parts to come in.

Another advisor had to look around to find my paperwork to help me out.  When my vehicle was pulled up, there was still something hanging down from under the car. A foreman came out, got under the car and said it was fine. The next day I got in the car and the outside temperature gauge was reading over 140 degrees.

She replied that she couldn't tell whether or not it was complete as the individual pieces of the set had no numbers on the spines. Um ... ok?

Now look, I know they're in the business to make money. I anticipated some of the discs to be deemed worthless in their eyes (I did have a handful of bargain-bin titles, after all).

I brought my own bike and helmet so it was only around $21 bucks for all day. My buddy didn't have a bike or a helmet so $21 for getting in, $15 for a rental bike, $5 for a helmet. I can't really say anything negative about that or pricing because most people have there own gear plus the prices are super reasonable.

The one constant between the four flavors that I sampled were that they were at least sort of moist. But flavorful, meh, not so much. I tried the chocolate, carrot, lemon, and caramel. \n\nSo here is the breakdown on the little cakes:\n1) The chocolate is (duh) chocolate cake with a chocolate/raspberry  mouse filling and topped with ganache. The cake was dark like chocolate, but pretty dull in flavor. The filling was there, but not discernable enough to stand out as a flavor unto itself. And the ganache was more like dry chocolaty icing. IMO, not really worth the calories.\n2) The caramel is a butter cake (think yellow) filled with caramel mouse and topped with a light caramel frosting. The cake was a pretty standard yellow cake. The filling was again so mild in flavor that there really wasn't much point in its being there. The frosting, described as mildly flavored, was more of an understatement. I really think it was white frosting with a light glazing of caramel underneath. IMO, really not worth the calories or the price. \n3)The carrot is filled with cream cheese mouse and topped with cream cheese frosting. At least this one resembled it's description, but I wasn't blown away.\n4) The lemon is a lemon cake, filled with lemon chiffon, and topped with lemon frosting. This was the closest thing to decent in the half dozen that I took home. I couldn't detect any lemon in the cake, but the filling almost had a hint of tartness and the frosting actually had some zest mixed in (which is what I would expect).\n\nI will definitely support Sweet Thang as a downtown addition, but will probably stick to their lunches.

We ended up having to tell three different wait staff a total of four times that we were still working on our meal and not yet ready to have our plates cleared away.\n\nAlthough we expect the prices at restaurants in Las Vegas to be higher than in Tucson, we still thought that this restaurant was somewhat overpriced considering it's off the Strip and caters to mostly locals.\n\nPhoto design by Billie Z.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Every time I visit Vegas, I try to eat here.

Here's why:\n\nMy grandparents came all the way from Hawaii to stay here and they were excited, as were we.\n\nThat thought quickly changed when we met Rosa and Dawn. Rosa is the nurse manager that oversees the medications and med tech staff. My grandparents lived at Merrill Gardens for about 4 months and after getting to know Rosa she does not care about the people living there. We payed extra ($800) for the staff to distribute medications and in the beginning they would constantly call me for refills?! I am not a doctor! And later after asking a lot of questions I found out that they have an in house pharmacy that costs nothing to have the medications sent to them! Also, my grandma took a walk because she had a disagreement with my grandpa and Rosa insists that because grandma did that she has dementia. She is a nurse not a doctor so she cannot diagnose. She then told me that my grandma cannot stay by herself so we needed to hire someone that night to stay with her or she had to go to memory care! (More money to be paid to Merrill Gardens).\n\nDawn, who is the general manager, doesn't care about anything but money either. She called to tell me about my grandmother taking a walk and it sounded like she could care less either. Just when you talk to her you get the feeling like she doesn't have the caring spirit which is something really important when you are living your beloved grandparents there.\n\nAlso, one of the med techs (her ethnicity was Spanish) told me that she \"didn't know\" if she could help my grandpa use his mouth wash after having oral surgery and she would have to ask her boss. That's the kind of response I get paying $800 extra every month in addition to sky rocket price Merrill gardens charges in the first place.\n\nWe payed $4081 for both my grandparents a month and we were not satisfied at all. Nothing was satisfying. The only staff member I liked was the filipino lady up front. She was kind and welcomed my grandma with adobo to make her feel at home when she first arrived. When they would throw \"parties\" for the veterans for example, everything was super cheap; jelly bean goody bags, cheap microwaveable food, cheap decorations. Where does all the money go to?\n\nOh yea, they also \"watched\" and accused my grandmother of taking clothes from the community dryer. When she returned it to the front desk. How do they know her intent was to steal? Maybe she was washing and forgot where her clothes were? \n\nChris the assistant manager was helpful because he helped get grandpa a ride to the dentist when I wasn't available. But when we were moving out, he emailed my mom when we were going to get the rest of the things out (keep in mind this is the second day of moving and we have 30 days to move out). Why he did that you may ask? Probably to make more money for Merrill Gardens and sign another resident up for that room. \n\nThis place and the apartment may look nice but do not leave your beloved elderly family member with them.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "Stopped by this morning, the place is awesome, comfortable & smells incredible!

So the space was intimate. The bread was terrific.   There is an a la carte menu and a prefix dinner with starter, main and desert for about $35.

I understand the total for 5, two guests had 1 glass of wine and 1 guest had a black Russian, was just over $225, not bad for so many diners. \n\nThe not so good:\nWhen we arrived there was no host/hostess to check in with and we ended up finding our own table and seating ourselves, we even put 3 2 top tables together.  There was only one waiter, I am not sure if he was the only one for the upper and lower level, but seemed he was a bit over worked and there was only one other table of 4 and a table of 2 on the upper level and nobody on the lower level, 12 diners in totral.

Instead we got a scoop of vanilla ice cream sounded by some banana slices on some caramel sauce served on a square plate.  It looked like a plated version of a caramel banana sundae from Baskin Robbins.   I have made better banana flambe at home.  This was an opportunity to really shine but was a real disappointment.

You win #alltheawards for chicken tenders. \n\nBefore I talk about the rest of the food, here's an important life hack for this place: get on your Yelp app and use the wait list option. Yes, you can literally put yourself on the waitlist. It's always going to be busy. Don't act surprised, don't bitch about it, just deal with it. And if you don't feel like waiting (or talking to human beings), you can get on the Haberdish website and place to go orders. \n\nOur visit here we got: cheese straws (the only thing we didn't love), dill house pickles (bread & butter and a daily option as available), biscuits & bacon jam (the winner of the apps), deviled eggs (a very close runner up), chicken tenders, smoked chicken (Alabama White Sauce is what made this dish), sweet potato dumplings, mac n cheese with crispy chicken skins, broccolini, charred okra, tots, and the waffle for dessert. Before you plan an eating intervention for me, please note that this was all split among four people. I thought everything was delicious. I love their homemade hot sauce. The table as a whole did not love the sweet potato dumplings. They are different. I liked them, though I may not order them every time because there are so many delicious side options. On Sundays, they do chicken and waffles. Tuesdays, chicken and biscuits. \n\nI didn't do a cocktail this visit, just a glass of ros\u00e8. Colleen was just named Charlotte's best bartender by Thrillist. I have no doubt you can't go wrong with a drink here. \n\nThe most surprising thing for me was how affordable a meal can be. I paid for my ros\u00e8, an app, couple chicken tenders, couple sides, part of the dessert and spent less than $30 (before tip). \n\nIf you're not familiar with NoDa, a warning that parking completely blows in this neighborhood.

I do admit Filipino cuisine is still somewhat new to me- but if you know me enough, I am willing to try anything as long as it doesn't involve bugs.\nAnyways, so I knew Casa Manila was one of the popular local spots for Filipino food although I've heard both the positive and negative. I still wanted to give them a try since the restaurant is so close to Galleria (Korean market) that I go to every weekend.\n\nI dropped by for lunch on a Saturday and found the restaurant to be quite empty. I was surprised by the fact that they had a patio area since I never noticed it from outside driving by so often.\nWalking inside of Casa Manila made me feel like I was at a tropical resort and I loved all the bamboo and leafy decorations.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, we were served a basket of popcorn that was seasoned with something.. I have no idea what, but it was delicious! The popcorn was salty and sweet and it immediately made me crave beer. mmMMMMMM beer.\n\n\nOrdered: Coconut Ginger-Ginataang Stew 3/5\n\n* Long beans, squash and pepper for $12.99\n* For some reason I expected this dish to be served cold but it was served warm\n* Light coconut sauce covered crunchy long beans where squash was buttery.\n* I honestly didn't care much for the vegetables but really enjoyed the coconut sauce\n\nOrdered: Chicken SigSig 3/5\n\n* Served with garlic rice and fried eggs for $15.99\n* Now this is something I tried and enjoyed at Lamesa\n* This is meant to be mixed with the fried eggs thats served on top\n* Although I do enjoy this dish, it is quite heavy and oily for my taste\n* I def need some hot sauce to enjoy this since it is drenched in oil\n* SigSig is one of my preferred Filipino dishes but I can't eat a lot of it\n\nOrdered: Crispy Pork Binagoongan 3/5\n\n* Crispy pork belly lightly sauteed in house made shrimp paste topped with tamato, eggplant, onions and green mango for $14.99\n* I found this dish to be quite heavy and oily as well\n* Chopped eggplants and tomato that's served with the pork somewhat helps to balance out the heaviness of this dish\n\nSummary: Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Casa Manila but found every dish to be too heavy and way too oily. A lot of people who are familar with Filipino food has warned me in advance but it was still too much for my likings.\nI would recommend Casa Manila to anybody who wants to try Filipino food since they do offer quite the variety but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Merriam-Wester.com defines brownie as \"A small square or rectangle of rich usually chocolate cake often containing nuts.\"  But those of us who love brownies know that a brownie can be so much more.  Ask any American, and they would most likely tell you that they have had several brownies in their lifetime.  Brownies can vary in ingredients, and therefore, in texture and taste. A truly good brownie tastes delicious, smells good and looks appetizing.  When a brownie is also a good value that is the icing on the cake, so to speak. There is nothing quite as good as a warm, rich, delicious brownie.  The Caramel Nut Brownie at Charleston's Restaurant is the best of the best.  \n\nCharleston's Caramel Nut Brownie is a huge brownie, served warm, with creamy vanilla ice cream.  It is topped with delicious hot fudge topping, as well as a decadent caramel sauce, sprinkles of crunchy pecan slivers, and sweet, fluffy whipped topping.  \n\nOther restaurants, such as Chili's and BJ's, offer brownies on their dessert menu, but none compare to the Caramel Nut Brownie.  Chili's web site describes its Brownie Sundae as a \"Warm, rich chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate fudge.\"  I found the brownie to be hard, and the vanilla ice cream to be bland, hardly worth the $5.79 price. BJ's Restaurant web site describes its BJ's Brownie as \"Baked to order and served piping hot, this brownie with walnuts is topped with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge and mountains of whipped cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup and topped with a cherry.\" At $5.75, BJ's brownie is not a great value.  BJ's brownie is small, dry and tasteless.  The walnuts are bitter, and the whipped topping tastes artificial.\n\nWhen you order the Caramel Nut Brownie, the first thing you notice is the mouth-watering aroma.  The combined smell of the chocolate brownie and the caramel sauce is intoxicating.  Next, you will notice the size of the brownie.  It is huge, measuring at least four inches square, and two inches thick.  Of course, the most important thing about a brownie is the taste.  The brownie is fresh, and melts in your mouth.  It has an amazing chocolate taste.  The coldness of the creamy vanilla ice cream provides a perfect contrast to the warmth of the brownie. The ice cream is sweet, but not too sweet, and has an authentic vanilla flavor.  The hot fudge is warm, and rich.  The caramel sauce is the best I have ever tasted.  It is buttery, and thick, with just a hint of toffee flavor. On top there's a fresh, airy whipped topping and a sprinkling of fresh roasted pecan slivers. \n\nYou may think that the $5.99 price is high for a dessert, but once you see the size of the brownie, you will realize its value.  The brownie is big enough to share with your dining companion; therefore the value is increased even more. Be aware, though, that once you taste the Caramel Nut Brownie at Charleston's, you might not want to share! \nI urge you to try the Caramel Nut Brownie at Charleston's.

However, I firmly believe that you cannot treat people like garbage continually without karma coming back to you, and given how obviously miserable Kathy is with her life, she seems to be living in a constant state of bad karma.

The 2 stars represents the wonderful atmosphere, the preserved history AND how wonderful the very famous Balzac's is in the greater scheme of the entire Distillery District. \n\nThere are a couple of points if like to discuss briefly , or to mention. First, I have no idea WHY this beautiful building, especially as locals and tourists alone are there to use there cameras in this great Victorian industry, that NO PHOTOS ARE PERMITTED . \n\nThe only other places where you really should not take photos is a gallery - that makes sense, they I can appreciate . But for The most illogical and bizarre reason(s), taking PHOTOGRAPHS IN THIS PUBLIC space is a definite no, no. I literally have no idea why you cannot take photographs inside what is essentially nothing more than a coffee shop. I would LOVE to find out the rationale, even though I have seen countless people thinking to themselves, \"why can't I photograph this beautiful Victorian space, the architecture, the original fixtures, the beautiful staircase among all kinds of wonderful and interesting items designed for it TO be seen , and take photos regardless. \n\nSecond, the coffee is exceptionally tar-sands thick and tasteless no matter how much sugar you add to a coffee. Don't get me wrong, you are in the Distillery and prices are higher, so let's understand that. But in talking with other visitors,there has at times been agreements that McDonalds or Tim Hortons has far far better coffee. I'm not sure if this is a very traditional way of roasting coffee, which if it is, I can understand. It may be me, but I've heard other visitors with the same opinion. Anyways. \n\nRest assured, it's a definite stop in the Distillery for its own sake. Again, and I've seen employees SAY BLUNTLY to tourists, no cameras are allowed to their utter confusion of people from other parts outside of Toronto visiting. What is this place, the Vatican Archives? \n\nSo be aware of that, pictures are taken by so many individuals because of its rustic beauty. Why else do you think that people want to come to the Distillery? Something you could always ask if you are forced to put your travellers' cameras away. \n\nPrices are generally higher but still I would recommend a visit to Balzac's just to sit back in the sun on the patio and watch the world go by.

(If you're handicapped, you'd have a problem anyway, as there are stairs _down_ from the street into the lobby!)\n--The block is not the greatest. Apparently, this part of Jarvis Street is at the edge of what Toronto considers a \"ghetto\" (!). I never had a problem, but, especially at night, it just pays to keep your eyes open.\n--The staff are very friendly and helpful -- the woman who checked me in even took phone messages for me the first two days -- though they tend to \"shut down\" when asked for something they can't provide. When I asked for a lower-floor room, they couldn't offer one (and maybe they couldn't, or maybe they simply say no to avoid the requests).

The store itself is very tiny but it's packed full and tidy. I actually wasn't expecting it to look more like a boutique. However it doesn't have boutique prices. It's very reasonable.\n\nI didn't see a separate area for plus sized items, but then they may not have had a lot of plus sized inventory. That's alright. I found some stuff anyways. They have some high end purses and shoes. They have a little corner for jewelry, home accessories, and also a wall of jackets. \n\nI bought a Ralph Lauren cream coloured jacket that was $4.99. It had some stains on it, thus the price but I'm very good at getting stains out. It was a great find. If items are in perfect condition, they are priced accordingly but still very very reasonable. Most things ranged between $4-$15.  Most jeans seemed to be under $7. The high end of the scale was for some really nice things in big brand names.  They also have coach bags and other high end brands. I also noticed they had a layaway at least for the coach bags. I don't know if the store has a layaway programme for all purchases, can't hurt to ask. \n\nOrphaned movies without the plastic dvd holder were $1. Saw a cool pair of TUK creepers from the UK for $13 I think. Lots of cool jackets. Not a lot over $20 (and if it is, it's a really really nice brand) most of them seemed to be nearer to $10 or lower.\n\nThe clothing seemed really trendy as well. Not a lot of junk. It was all current styles and timeless ones as well. The store was clean and had a lot of personality.\n\nThe childrens toy area is small but clean and well organised.\n\nThey also had small home appliances like a mixer and stand. Didn't look at the brand but it was nice and clean. $28 I think. Don't quote me on that.\n\nThere was a really cute space heater not more than a foot tall or wide but it looked like a mini fireplace. $28 bucks as well. I've never seen one so tiny and would have been perfect for my office but I just bought a heater for christmas.\n\nI did not notice a changing room, perhaps there was one, I don't know.\n\nI decided to write this review because I want them to do well. It's not often the water street side of Henderson gets a really nice little boutique like store.\n\nMet the owners, they're a nice couple.

The manager came by to discuss the crappy bun and comped her meal. She didn't want to wait for them to make another hamburger. I don't blame her. It really looked brutal. Another coworker ordered the beet salad and when it didn't have the goat cheese it said on the menu, our waitress said a lot of people don't want it. But she did bring it out after. However, it was already after my coworker had almost finished her salad and if you can believe this, all the cheese she got was a tiny blob in a shot glass. You gotta be kidding me. What a joke.
